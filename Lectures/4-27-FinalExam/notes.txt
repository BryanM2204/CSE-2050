Q1 
    - __next__ is expected to raise a StopIteration error to terminate a for loop


Q2
    - post-order = 
        yield self.data is at the end so "post" everything else
        ex. -
            yield from self.left
            yield from self.right
            yield self

    - pre-order - root is printed out first "yield self.item" comes first before other yields
        ex. - 
            yield self
            yield from self.left
            yield from self.right

    - in-order 
        yield from self.left
        yield self
        yield self.right
        This traversal type prints the values in the nodes in sorted order 


Q14
    - Binary max-heap
        - goes from big to small - check roots and children - children must be smaller


Q17
    - simple graphs don't self loop nor has multiple edges

Q21
    - O(E) 

- prim only works with undirected graphs
    - has unique behavior:
        ex. - if you have any number of verticies and all edges are unique = the minumum edge from every vertex is in must
    - PQ based on minimum edge to add vertex
    - creates minimum spanning Treesmallest ege from each vertex is in the MST
- Dijkstra
    - PQ based on minimum distance from source
    - same as BFS if all weights are the same 
    - Directed or undirected grpahs 
    - Tree is not unique

Running Times
    - Put
        - Heap = log(n)
        - BST = logn
    - Remove_min
        - heap = logn
        - BST = logn
    - contains
        - heap = O(n) [O(1) with dictionary]
        - BST = logn
    - floor / ceiling 
        - heap = O(n)
        - BST = logn
    - peak
        - heap = O(1)
        - BST = logn
