Immutatble - strings and tuples

Tuples are immutable, so they can go in sets - mayeb a set of 2-d coordinates (x,y)

encapsulation - comines the instance vairables and methods of an object into a single class
    - also: hiding what is happening under the hood

Users are able to access private variables because private variables don't exist in python

all classes in python are subclasses to object

we are most likely to inotrduce composition in the __init__ methods

Question: Name and describe the three phases of test-driven development
Red - write a test and run it to verify that it fails and it fails for the reason we expect
Green - modify code to pass test classes
Refactor - factor out any dyplicate code to keep our code DRY

Big-O notation gives an upper bound - there is an upper bound that runs worse than our code 
    -Ex. - function runs 5n+1 = O(n) - there is some linear function that is slower (6n+1)
        - n(naugt) is where crossover happens in which the other function is worse (intersection)

nested for loops that depend on the list - not quadratic

Wrapper pattern is:
    -Wrapper patterns use an exisitng data structure to implement a public interface
    -Benefits = use previous function with "standard" interface
    -Allows me to limit functionallity to what the inerface defines
        -ex. - self._L = [] in a stack class - the list is only used for the functionality of a stack and not for list - rebranded
    -Make a stack w/ a linked list
    -Make a stack w/ a DLL

Stack vs. queue
    -Stack is LIFO - last in first out
    -Qeueu is FIFO - first in first out

linked list vs. DLL
    -Linked list can only be traversed forwards - this makes finding nodes near the end very slow
    -DLL has next and prev pointers so it can be traversed both ways
    -DLL uses ~3 attributes per object
        -50% more memory used than a linked list
    -LL stores 2 attributes per object

raise TypeError('wrong Type!')

Linked list used to make a queue
    -Remove first and add last are both O(1) in a linked list

Time complexity of finding hte min element in a sorted list is O(1)
